# Loan-Calculator-UI
CISC181 Final Project

# About
Welcome to my Loan Calculator website, a user-friendly tool designed to help individuals understand and manage their loan payments effectively. The site features an intuitive interface where users can input their loan details, including amount, interest rate, term, and extra payments. With real-time calculations and a detailed payment schedule, users can visualize their financial commitments and explore the impact of additional payments on their overall interest savings.
